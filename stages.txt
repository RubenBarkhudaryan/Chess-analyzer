
If you want next level validation, we can add:

Kings not adjacent -> done

Pawns not on first/last rank -> done

Both kings not simultaneously in check -> in process...

Illegal double check states

That’s when your parser becomes engine-grade ♟️


🔥 3. Verify That Kings Are Not In Check If Position Claims It’s Legal

Even more strict:

If your engine says:

“Position is legal”

But white king is already in check from 3 pieces

→ maybe config is intentionally illegal

You decide policy.
